Auto Build & Deploy Model
-------------------------

This project contains a standalone python application that will execute 
a DataRobot autopilot and return the project and model id. In addition
it can automatically deploy the recommended model, replacing an existing
deployment where one exists.

You will be able to use this script as a starting point to customise your
own autopilot run and model selection criteria.

## Instructions

See the [RUN.sh](RUN.sh) script for a usage example.
